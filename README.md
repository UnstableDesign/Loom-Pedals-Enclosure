# Loom Pedals: Hardware

The Loom Pedals are a hardware peripheral interface for improvisational Jacquard weaving, based on a set of modular foot pedals. They have been implemented for the TC2 digital Jacquard loom by Tronrud Engineering. The pedals, inspired by effects pedals used by musicians, are connected via a Raspberry Pi to a web-based open source weaving software, AdaCAD. This repository contains files pertaining to the hardware design for the pedal modules.
