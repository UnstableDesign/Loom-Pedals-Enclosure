# Loom Pedals: Hardware

The loom pedals are a hardware peripheral interface for the TC2 digital Jacquard loom by Tronrud Engineering. They have been designed as a modular system of foot pedals, similar to guitar effects pedals used by musicians, which are connected via a Raspberry Pi to a web-based open source weaving software, AdaCAD. This repository contains files pertaining to the hardware design for the pedal modules.
